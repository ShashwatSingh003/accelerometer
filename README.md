# accelerometer
In this we have tried to show variations and understand how accelerometer works and how it varies with respect to x,y and z axis when we perform different actions such as sleeping,standing,sitting,running,forward bending and backward bending.

We can also see the changes in acceleration due to the gravitional acceleration acting on the accelerometer sensors.
